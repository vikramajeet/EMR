Eleven thousand years ago with the emergence of the system of bartering the first men and women started exchanging goods.Back then people would only trade with other people within their tribe that they knew and trusted ,but as years went by and the population started growing exponentially it became harder and harder to personally know and trust everyone moreover people went from exchanging simple objects to trading different kind of assets and, therefore individuals started calling on middleman like banks or governments to protect their interests but what happens when the trust replace in such third parties is shattered. A anonymous person or a group of people or maybe a woman created a white paper on which  it was writen that About a peer to peer electronic cash system using the new cryptocurrency bitcoin although. you may be familiar with bitcoin but you may not be  familiar with the technology required for it to work block chain.   So what is block chain?  Block chain  is a system that stores information in a network of personal computers called nodes there is no central entity like a bank or a government controlling it the system is what do we called distribute it that means that all the computers in the network have the same information.  Imagine the block chain like a big public ledger that lists all the transactions that have been executed betweeen two parties each transaction is time stamped and immutable that means that once you add a transaction or an information to the block chain you cannot go back and change it or delete it the people in the network that add and verify the transaction are called miners to do so they take the transaction information run it through a secure hash algorithm that provides them with unique output called a hash. The hash his stored on the block and not the transaction information that it means that if you see or have the hash you cannot go back and retrieved the transaction information this ensures privacy each hash is added to a ledger and the ledger is stored in the block each  block is linked to the previous one creating a chain the block chain. Of course the block chain doesn't store just a list of transactions it can provide proof of existence for any document like audio files images or even complete medical records there are lot of use cases with block chain for one main reason the power block chain lights in the fact that it can prove that are unique event occurred at the certain time that event can be either financial transaction older creation of a new document now this charecterstic is very powerful  as you can imagine and many sectors are very interested in like health care in health care as well there are many use caeses for block chain for one main reason ensuring trust in the medical community ,in scientist or in pharmaceuticial industry is essential to leverage scientific progress and improve the quality of care.       For example a problem that I believe you have all faced when you go to the doctors even if it's in a very critical state your doctor often has to run a series of tests to know what's going on with you even if the colleague from another hospital have already done so previously. As there is no way for a hospital to retrieve the information from another hospital of course that results in a massive loss of time money and eventually life. This brings us to a big problem in the healthcare sector that is the lack of interoperability.The medical and scientific communities don't have access to data and when they finally find the information it becomes hard to find the patient and ask for consent but now imagine we have a system like a ledger. let's say that lists all the information about the patient or his medical history and now imagine that the ledger is public and accessible for doctors nurses pharmacists scientists imagine that we have a system that allows us to access the data only upon consent given by the patient now stop imagining it because it's happening and it's called the blockchain.  It can be done in four really easy steps  1.Health care providers collect information from the patient. 2.The data is stored in existing databases in hospitals  3.then this is where it gets tricky a hash is creating from each source of the data and is redirected to the blockchain for the patient decides who has access to his own medical records 4.Healthcare stakeholders (validator) can create the blockchain and access the information.  Now here comes a problem, how we can manage and create access to the information. The answer is smart contracts . Smart contracts are contracts that are written as code into the blockchain when a triggering event is hit the contract automatically executes itself for instance  Here in this case when a doctor asks for permission to access the information if the patient gives consent the contract automatically allows the doctors to see the results blockchain.  Smart contracts provide two big advantages first the system is finally patient-centered because the patient now owns his medical records of course the patient cannot just go and modify everything or deleted but he can decide who has access to the information we are solving the trust issue in the healthcare system secondly the blockchain can act like a catalog that lists all the medical records of the patient and all his medical history (maybe genetic) that way the next time you go to the doctors instead of having him doing all the tests again he will just have to contact his colleague and ask for the information of course with patient consent.
